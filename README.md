# Library Project

This was created as part of Odin Project - Full Stack JavaScript.

This simple function uses constructor functions, a book is defined as a constructor function. Books are added into an array and then displayed using a HTML Table. The code is really simple and easy to follow.

CSS is mainly done using Bootstrap.
